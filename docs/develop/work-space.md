# The Work space: the hub's side

The hub's code for the Work space lives in `runtime/crates/drgnx-ratatoskr/src/work/`. The pure parts take no clock and
no I/O, so tests run them in every order or directly.

## Shell reads

Layer 1 of "reads through shell commands" (the files a command names; labelled "from the command") is
`work::shell_read`.

- `parse(cmd) -> Parsed` reads the text of a shell step and sorts the words that name files into `reads`, `writes`,
  `listed` (a directory listing or a recursive search without a path: `ls`, `find`, `fd`, `tree`, `rg foo`), `scripts`
  (`./x.sh`, `python y.py`, `source z`) and `cds`. It is table-driven over the heads `cat head tail less more wc cut
  sort diff jq grep rg ag ack sed awk find fd ls tree tee` and the interpreters and shells. It understands pipes,
  `&& || ; &`, redirections (`< f` read, `> f` `>> f` `&> f` write, `2>&1` nothing), quotes, `cd X &&` prefixes,
  leading `VAR=x`, `env`, `time`, `timeout`, `nice` and a `bash -c '…'` string parsed once.
- What it cannot know is left out and named in `skipped`, never guessed: `$(…)`, backticks, variables, `xargs` and
  `find -exec` input, a `bash -c` inside a `bash -c`, a heredoc, a subshell, `for`/`case`, a `cd` to an unknown place.
- `resolve(parsed, cwd, roots, glob_cap) -> Resolved` places the words: `~`, the `cd`s in order, simple globs (`*` `?`
  `[…]`, at most `glob_cap` matches per step, 200 in the hub; a glob over the cap, with no match, or with braces or
  `**` goes to `patterns`). Paths are made canonical (symlinks followed, `..` applied, also for a file that does not
  exist yet) and **only paths under the roots are kept**: a `..`, a symlink or a `cd` that leaves the workspace is
  dropped. A read of something missing is not a read, and a read of a directory is a listing.
- Tests: `work::shell_read::tests` (class `det`, pattern D, with a property test over the corpus and random words),
  the corpus in `src/work/shell_read/corpus.txt`, and the timing row `shell_parse_within_200_us`
  (`tests/work_timing.rs`, listed in `test/timing-rust.txt`, 200 µs at p95).

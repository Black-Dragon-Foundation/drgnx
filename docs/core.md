# The drgnx core

The core is what every drgnx session loads before any module: paths, staged hooks, the no-prompt guard, the
command registry and every surface generated from it, the command palette, and a minimal module system. It uses
no third-party packages. Boot it with `emacs --init-directory <checkout>/init` — or in a harness session with
`bin/drgnx ui start --config drgnx`.

```
init/early-init.el   packages not activated by Emacs (drgnx-init activates drgnx's own — packages.md); no tool bar
init/init.el         core/ on the load path, (require 'drgnx), (drgnx-init)
core/drgnx.el        drgnx-init: guard on, staged hooks armed, packages activated, core commands, modules, surfaces
                     (DRGNX_SAFE — drgnx safe — skips packages and modules)
modules/<category>/drgnx-<name>.el   one drgnx-module-define per file
```

## Paths (`drgnx-paths.el`)

`drgnx-dir` is the checkout (code only, never written to). User configuration: `(drgnx-user-dir)` —
`$DRGNX_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.config/drgnx/`. State and caches: `(drgnx-state-dir)` and `(drgnx-cache-dir)` under
the XDG directories. Packages: `(drgnx-data-dir)` — `$DRGNX_DATA_DIR` or `~/.local/share/drgnx/` — holds `elpa/`
(the packages every session uses) and `generations/`; `(drgnx-package-cache-dir)` keeps downloaded package files
([packages.md](packages.md)).

## Staged hooks (`drgnx-hooks.el`)

Work that need not happen at startup hangs on a stage and runs once, when the stage is first reached:
`drgnx-first-input-hook` (before the first command), `drgnx-first-file-hook` (first visited file),
`drgnx-first-gui-frame-hook` (first graphical frame — for a daemon, the first `emacsclient -c`). Each function
runs under its own error guard; errors are collected in `drgnx-hooks-problems`, never shown as prompts.

## No prompts in automatic paths (`drgnx-guard.el`)

A prompt asked from a timer, a hook or while the daemon starts has nobody to answer it, and the daemon freezes.
`drgnx-guard-mode` (on in every drgnx session) makes `y-or-n-p`, `yes-or-no-p`, `read-string`,
`read-from-minibuffer`, `completing-read`, `read-passwd`, `read-number`, `read-file-name`,
`read-directory-name` and `read-buffer` signal `drgnx-prompt-in-automatic-path` instead — naming the prompt and
where it was asked from — when called:

- from a timer (detected by wrapping `timer-event-handler`; commands run by a nested command loop, such as a
  minibuffer opened by a command, are not timer code);
- inside `(drgnx-automatic …)` — use it for hook functions, process filters and sentinels (Emacs calls those
  from C, so they cannot be detected);
- while a daemon initialises.

## Command registry (`drgnx-registry.el`)

Every command is registered once, without keys:

```elisp
(drgnx-command-define 'palette
  :category "View" :title "Command Palette"
  :command #'drgnx-palette :menu '("View") :doc "Every command by name, with its key")
```

Keys: `:title`, `:category`, `:command` (required), `:scope` (`app` default, `editing` or `window` — which key-profile
layers key it), `:map` (the keymap its keys go into by default: nil for global, a keymap symbol, or
`(FEATURE . KEYMAP)` for a keymap that exists once FEATURE loads), `:menu` (menu-bar path), `:context` (right-click
contexts), `:context-first`, `:doc` and `:when` (a predicate: the command is offered only while it holds).
Redefining an id replaces it. **Keys come from key profiles** ([keys.md](keys.md)); the active keys of a command
are in its `bound` slot, which every surface reads. The entries keep the ids of the gryphn layer's registry, which
this is ported from.

## Surfaces (`drgnx-surfaces.el`, `drgnx-palette.el`)

Generated from the registry, never written by hand, showing the keys of the active key profiles: the menu bar,
right-click menus (contexts via `drgnx-surfaces-define-context`), which-key labels (when which-key is present),
the **key sheet** ("Keyboard Shortcuts", `*drgnx keys*`), a markdown cheat sheet (`drgnx-surfaces-export-markdown`), "next time:
KEY" tips after a command run from a menu or the palette, and the **command palette** (`C-S-p` in every profile): every available
command as "Category: Title" with its key and description beside it, through the normal completion UI.

## Modules (`drgnx-modules.el`)

```elisp
(drgnx-module-define 'core/basics
  :doc "Quiet, predictable defaults and the basic file and view commands."
  :stage 'startup
  :setup (lambda () …))
```

Module files are `modules/<category>/drgnx-<name>.el`. Stages: `startup` (during `drgnx-init`) and `idle` (once
Emacs is idle). Each setup runs under its own error guard and is timed; a file that fails to load is reported as
a module too. "Help: Module Report" (`drgnx-modules-show-report`) lists stage, milliseconds and errors. Flags,
settings, doctor checks, more stages and the modules index come with M4.

## Build (`drgnx-build.el`)

`bin/drgnx build` byte-compiles `core/`, `wb/` and `modules/` in place (`.elc` files are not tracked); with native
compilation available, Emacs then compiles them natively in the background as they load. Compiled drgnx is several
times faster and makes far less garbage. `install.sh` runs it; drgnx sets `load-prefer-newer`, so a stale `.elc`
never shadows newer source. The build must stay warning-free (`test/unit/build-test.el`).

## Doctor (`drgnx-doctor.el`)

`bin/drgnx doctor [--json] [--dev]` asks the Emacs drgnx will use (`$DRGNX_EMACS`, else `emacs`) whether this
machine is ready, and gives a fix for anything that is not:

```
OK    emacs-version        Emacs 31.1                 (30.2: WARN — works, 31.1 recommended; older: FAIL)
OK    native-compilation   native compilation works   (built without it, or libgccjit broken: FAIL)
OK    tree-sitter          tree-sitter available
OK    gui                  graphical build (pgtk)     (terminal-only: WARN)
WARN  security             known issues up to 31.1, fixed in 31.2 (TRAMP, Flymake, read-symbol-shorthands)
OK    git                  git found
```

Native compilation is checked by actually compiling a function, not only by asking whether it is built in. Any
FAIL makes the exit status 1. `--dev` adds the tools for developing drgnx (mutter, dbus-run-session, ImageMagick, a
pgtk Emacs) and the environment, container runtime and session launcher. Without any Emacs, the doctor prints the
installer command. Checks are defined with `drgnx-doctor-define`; modules will add their own (M4).

## Tests

Batch: `test/unit/core-*-test.el`. In a session: `test/live/drgnx-boot-test.el` boots `config=drgnx` and checks
the registry, the guard (a `y-or-n-p` from a timer signals), the palette (`C-S-p`), the key sheet (F1) and the
module report. Scenarios run against drgnx with `bin/drgnx test --scenario`; the workbench ones skip until M3.
